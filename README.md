# CustomerRepo
This repo is used for technical interviews

# Instructions

1. Create a class for a customer with properties for Id (int), Name (string), and Zip Code (up to you)
2. Create a method for creating a customer and saving for later retrieval.
3. Create a method for fetching all customers.
4. Create a method to fetch a customer by Id.

# Considerations after completion

1. Is there a way to quickly fetch a customer by Id if there are 1 million customers?
2. What would you need to do to make this project support a database?
